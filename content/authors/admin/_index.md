I am a PhD candidate at Instituto de Física Teórica. I am interested in using machine learning tools to study fundamental particle physics.

My research focuses on developing new data-driven techniques to find anomalous signals at the Large Hadron Collider. I have experience building mathematical models to explain particle physics phenomena and exploring the experimental signatures they would produce.
